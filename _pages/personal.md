Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring creative and physical pursuits. Recently, Iâ€™ve begun learning **aerial dance** and playing the **handpan**. I also hold a **2nd Dan black belt in Taekwondo** and used to spend time painting. Beyond that, I love **traveling** and discovering new places, cultures, and perspectives.
