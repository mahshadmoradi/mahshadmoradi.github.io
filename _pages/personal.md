Beyond my academic and research interests, I have a deep passion for the arts, sports, and adventure.  

### 🎶 Music & Creativity  
I play the **Handpan**, an instrument that allows me to express emotions through its mesmerizing and meditative sound. Music is my way of unwinding and connecting with the present moment.  

### 🥋 Martial Arts  
I hold a **2nd Dan black belt in Taekwondo**, a discipline that has shaped my perseverance, discipline, and mindset. The balance between physical training and mental focus is something I deeply value.  

### 🎨 Painting & Artistic Expression  
Painting is another creative outlet I enjoy, allowing me to explore colors, emotions, and perspectives beyond words. Whether through abstract strokes or detailed sketches, I find art to be a powerful form of storytelling.  

### ✈️ Traveling & Exploration  
I love **traveling**—exploring different places, cultures, lives, and stories. Whether it's wandering through ancient cities, experiencing diverse traditions, or meeting new people, I find immense joy in discovering the world's endless wonders.
