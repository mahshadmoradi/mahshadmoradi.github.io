### Hello World!  

I am Mahshad Moradi, a B.Sc. graduate in Electrical Engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.ir). During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to intern at the [Business Analytics Lab (BAN)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ban/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). I was also fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Arash Amini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=3ekS0ucAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
